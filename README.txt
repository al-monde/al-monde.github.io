PLEASE KINDLY READ!

My project has only one "Book" page (bookpage.html) with all the information regarding an individual book. It is implied that during a real life project
I would have made a "book template" and used it across all other books, thus eliminating the need to dublicate the same
HTML page multiple times.

Thank you for your understanding.
